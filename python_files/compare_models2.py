# # Compare machine learning models
#
# In this notebook, we will compare 3 pre-trained models that predict the
# **Census Region** of a respondent based on their survey answers.
#
# The 3 models are:
# - **Logistic Regression**: a simple linear model
# - **Random Forest**: a model based on many decision trees
# - **Gradient Boosting**: a model that builds trees sequentially

# %% [markdown]
# ## Load the dataset

# %%
from skrub.datasets import fetch_midwest_survey

dataset = fetch_midwest_survey()
X = dataset.X
y = dataset.y

# %%
# To simplify evaluation, we will group categories in the target to deal with
# a binary classification problem instead of a multiclass one.
y = y.apply(
    lambda x: "North Central"
    if x in ["East North Central", "West North Central"]
    else "other"
)

# %%
# Train / test split based on a sample of 1000 rows for training
sample_idx = X.sample(n=1000, random_state=1).index
X_train = X.loc[sample_idx].reset_index(drop=True)
y_train = y.loc[sample_idx].reset_index(drop=True)
X_test = X.drop(sample_idx).reset_index(drop=True)
y_test = y.drop(sample_idx).reset_index(drop=True)

# ## Load the 3 models
#
# The models were saved as `.pkl` files. We use `joblib` to load them.

# %%

# Let's inspect what each model looks like. They are **pipelines**: they
# first transform the data, then make predictions.

#
# To fairly evaluate each model, we use **cross-validation**.

# We define the positive class as **\"North Central\"** and use
# `EstimatorReport` to compute precision, recall and f1-score.

# - False positive: -10
# - False negative: -1

# the most useful predictions in practice under this cost setup.

#
# We compare train and test accuracy for each model, and also look at the
# cross-validation scores computed earlier.

# %% [markdown]
# Using the train/test accuracies and the cross-validation means printed
# above, we can determine:
# - which model has the **smallest gap** between train and test accuracy
#   (best generalization),
# - which model has the **largest gap** and is likely overfitting.
